# RustyPosets
Rust code for manipulating finite partially ordered sets.

Finite posets are combinatorially intricate structures. They can be represented computationally in different way, and the chosen representation affects,
some times quite strongly, the computational complexity of algorithms that compute, create, or manipulate posets. The aim of this repository is 
to provide code to support different representations of finite posets, together with implementations of algorithms for each form of presentation, and
functionality to convert between the different forms.
